## 🚀 Project Overview

The AWS Secure Cost-Aware Cloud Platform was built to:
- Deploy and monitor EC2-based workloads
- Enforce secure access using IAM least-privilege principles
- Monitor system health using CloudWatch
- Maintain awareness of cloud usage and cost

This project reflects real-world **cloud operations and security fundamentals**.
